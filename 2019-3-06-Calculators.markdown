Welcome to the new series on calculator efficiency. In the next few weeks we will be discussing how to use the TI-84 Plus and the TI-84 Plus CE faster, and better, using it to solve more problems. Effective use of a calculator is key to standardized testing such as the SAT or ACT, or any calculator part of a test.

Come Mondays to the Darby Computer and Technology club in Mrs. White's room (room 134).
