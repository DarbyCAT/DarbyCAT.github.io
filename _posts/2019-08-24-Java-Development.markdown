Java is the chosen language for APCSP. We use Visual Studio Code to write in Java because it looks nicer than Eclipse and we don't need super advanced debugging utilities. Click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u3ByQ-xXaWT_TfhXYINTQD1VZvFVNUFs/view?usp=sharing) to download a portable, preconfigured version of Visual Studio Code.

**Make sure you are signed in to your Hilliard Schools account to gain access**

What does portable mean?
It is a zip file which you download and extract (on to your desktop, for example), then when you want to use Visual Studio Code you open the folder (or create a shortcut to it) and ***Punch It, Chewie!***
