This is the second part of the dodging game we've been making. It now has collision detection/lose detection, score tracking, and optimization/better performance. If you fell behind or just want to peak at the [commented source code](https://editor.p5js.org/lameman2000/sketches/Bytjerec7), which explains each step. Next week we will be doing more complicated projectile movement, using trigonometry!

If you know anyone else that might be interested in the is sort of thing, you should invite them to come to the next meeting!
