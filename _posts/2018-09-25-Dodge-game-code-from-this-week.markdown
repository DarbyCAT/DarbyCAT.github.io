If you missed yesterday (September 24th) or left early, you can get caught up by copying the [source code](https://editor.p5js.org/joshua.sims@hilliardschools.org/sketches/B1N2E38tX). Read through it and feel free to ask questions if you don't understand anything. See you next week when we add
* better performance
* actual loss detection
* score
* high score
* more complicated projectile movement (with trig)

Also, if you know anyone else who would be interested in joining, tell them to come!
